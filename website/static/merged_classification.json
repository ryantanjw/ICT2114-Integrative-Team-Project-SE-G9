            "review_content": "I have stayed in many Aloft Marriott hotels all over the place from the Westcoast of the United States to East Asia. They are all great in their own ways, but by far the best experience I had was at this Aloft Singapore Novena. This hotel went through a huge remodeling/renovation in summer of 2023 with grand opening in Sept. It's gorgeous and only a 10 min drive to the heart of Singapore (Orchard Avenue). It's a perfect spot to come chill after visiting the busy city scenery. At check-in, I was greeted by the friendly front desk staff. The check-in process was incredibly smooth and fast. The hotel lobby is incredibly lively, clean and modern with nice music in the background. The WXYZ bar in the lobby is pretty attractive with a good selection. I will share my review of the bar further down in my review. The room is very modern and well maintained with comfortable mattress, pillows etc. Although I'm a frequent traveler and stay at hotels often, I rarely get used to the setup in any hotel environment and have a hard time adjusting/sleeping etc. but I had no issues during my 4 night stay here. The hotel restaurant Yue is another pleasant surprise with awesome great quality breakfast selection from western to asian. Staff Review: The staff, all the way from management to the floor staff, is always willing to help, always friendly, upbeat, smiling and make you feel right at home away from home. Jiven at the front office is super professional and helpful with a great personality. David, Zack, Barsilan and Sankary at the Yue hotel restaurant consistently demonstrate hospitality. Anyone who cross paths with these folks would end up with a smile on their face. Ask Barsilan for his yummy Thosai (Dossa) with Chatni. Last but not least, Zach and Thina at the WXYZ hotel bar are incredible hosts with great bartending skills. Ask Zach for his special Gin and Tonic infused with 'kafir' herb. It's dangerously delicious ;- ) The attentiveness of these two guys and their attention to gusts were a breadth of fresh air. The way the keep their bar shining clean at all times may not be noticeable by some, but I appreciated it heartily. These guys are Pros! Overall, I highly recommend Aloft Singapore Novena. I enjoyed my stay altogether and met incredibly kind and friendly people at this hotel. I am looking forward to going back in August!",

The subway will take you to the center or Marina Bay in ten to fifteen minutes. The hotel consists of two separate buildings and finding the entrance can be tricky, especially if you are arriving by foot. Our room was large and comfortable. Staff are numerous, friendly, and helpful. The pool is large and lovely. The breakfast is diverse and tasty, with Indian, Chinese, and Western offerings. The hotel is next to a small shopping center with a grocery and convenience store, and a food court, with a wide and delicious selection.",

She pointed out that if I waited until 8:00, I would be charged only half the rate for early check-in, and made sure that I got breakfast in the restaurant too. That level of helpfulness and attention to detail was my consistent experience.The only \"Meh\" in the whole week was the wine-by-the-glass in WXYZ; all the other drinks were much better. So was the wine in Yue, the hotel restaurant.It's a bit of a walk to the nearest MRT station (Novena), but the hotel runs a shuttle much of the day.If you're a runner or walker, be sure to go to the Park Connector nearby at Whampoa Park.",

I upgraded to family room, but was initially given twin room. Have to remind her I upgraded. 2) toilet bowl flushing strength was not gd and choked in the night. Have to endure the choked toilet bowl till the next day morning to call for reception. Lousy for a 4* hotel.3) plumber came and unchoked. But was a mess and promised that room service will come to clear up. No one came.4) breakfast was not gd. The restaurant manager was in a hurry to clear plates together with the utensils as well. Have to get her to replace the utensils she cleared.5) check out - served by a male staff. Informed him that I need a parking coupon but will only exit as I have a lunch reservation at another place. Was told I could only have the coupon upon exiting as the coupon was limited to 1 per day and may not work if exit too late. He warned me that the hotel will not be liable if the coupon can't work if I exit too late. I asked him to explain what he meant, but he keeps quiet when I challenged him. No apologies from any staff wrt the choked flushing system at check out even though 1 of the staff know which room I was from. Sorry to say but this hotel really cmi. Staff can't even or not bothered to do basic service recovery. Never felt so bad after a staycation, really spoilt my whole family mood. Frankly speaking, they don't even deserved 1 star rating.",

Upon check-in, I immediately discovered a cockroach on my bathroom floor - in plain sight, wiggling and on its last breath. DISGUSTING! .When I brought this up to the front desk manager, instead of apologizing and doing his best to comp and diffused the situation, he said it was brought in by other hotel guests. What?! What kind of a lame excuse is that? Then it got worse...he said there's no way the cockroach can get to the 8th floor (where my room is), because the restaurant is on the 3rd. So I said \"you mean to tell me hotel guests are not suppose to bring food into the room?\". To which he responded \"we don't recommend that \"lah\".\" And I said \"so you don't provide room service then - where you bring food into the room?\". He didn't have a clever comeback. .Oh my gosh, you need to send your hotel managers back to hotel management school 101, Concorde. Shame on you. One can overlook the dated building, furnishing and decor (on Orchard road no less), if the customer service was deserving a 4 star. Again, SHAME!!! .Your manager should have handled the situation better.",

From the pick up at Changi to the good bye two days later on the forecourt I was constantly reminded of the quiet professionalism and charm of the property and its staff.I have always loved the view down through the Towers of the Boulevard Room. It really does tick all the boxes.Of special note, when I arrived at breakfast, instead of being ushered into the buffet, I was immediately, and without prompting, taken to the a la carte quiet bar area; that was impressive, as the hotel knows my preference for quiet reflective dining.The service and the food at one ninety for breakfast was superb both mornings.Like the breakfast experience I really appreciated the adults only pool environment and enjoyed a wonderful contemplative swim one morning, it is not just the amenities which are important but the ambience. Though why people need to sit and do their office work by the pool glued to their lap top is something of a puzzle to me, nevertheless on the occasion I swam they were not obtrusive.The maintenance of the room was timely and efficient and the maid provided some nice touches and left notes for which thank you.The Four Seasons is well placed for the Botanical Gardens on one side and Ion Orchard on the other.I also appreciated the flexible arrangements offered over the room retention on the final day with a flight deep into the evening.Thank you for another wonderfully straightforward no nonsense stay with one or two elevated food moments.",

It was a beautiful venue, the set-up was spot-on, and the buffet spread was incredible. There was a minor hiccup, which was a tray of red wine ending up on the floor and all over the clothing of myself and another guest. However, this was quickly resolved by the staff who took our wine-stained items to dry-cleaning straight away. My cleaned jacket was delivered back to me at my hotel before 9am the next morning at no extra charge. The managers, Michelle, Rosnita and team were supportive and communicative throughout, and really went above and beyond to ensure this situation was resolved. It was fantastic service for someone who was just a guest at the wedding. I'm greatly appreciative - and well, I now have a clean jacket for my next destination! Thanks team!",

Also to our server who was a lady with black hair a bit on the older side whose name we never got but was so helpful and sweet. Also to Ewan the concierge who helped us every day with all our requests. And Wendy the general manager (we think) who we bumped into on our last day and chatted to for a while.

The folks at the reception were not only efficient but also super friendly, making me feel right at home from the moment I stepped in. And get this I arrived early, and my room was already set up for me at 10 am! Talk about VIP treatment.When I walked into my room, I was blown away by how spacious and modern it was. The bathroom was like something out of a magazine, with marble floors and a fancy shower and tub combo. They even asked me about my mattress preference before I arrived, and they had a whole pillow menu ready for me talk about attention to detail!I decided to upgrade to the executive club, which came with breakfast totally worth it. The breakfast spread was delicious, and the staff in the club lounge were top-notch. They really went above and beyond to make sure I had a great start to my day.And let's not forget about the pool and spa they were both amazing. The lap pool on the 3rd floor was so peaceful, and the spa experience was out of this world. My massage therapist was incredible, and I left feeling like a whole new person.The dining experiences were fantastic too, especially at the Nobu restaurant onsite. Sure, there was a small hiccup with one of the bar staff, but overall, everyone was super helpful and friendly.All in all, the Four Seasons in Singapore has definitely become my go-to spot whenever I'm in town. The service, amenities, and overall experience were just unbeatable. Huge thanks to the Four Seasons team for making my stay so memorable!",

            "review_content": "During our recent stay at the hotel, which was specially chosen to celebrate our anniversary, we had high expectations based on our previous experiences with luxury accommodations, including those within the FSS chain in other cities like Bangkok. The hotel acknowledged our special occasion by arranging a thoughtful anniversary setup, a gesture we sincerely appreciated and which set a positive tone upon our arrival.However, despite this warm welcome, the overall service experience did not align with the high standards we anticipated. Upon arrival around 2 PM, we found our room was not yet ready. While we understand that delays can happen, the lack of communication and guidance on how we could comfortably wait was surprising. When inquiring about an alternative place to relax, the response from the staff was noticeably unclear, leading us to suggest the pool area ourselves. Even then, the absence of proactive hospitality, such as the offer of refreshments or a menu while we waited, was felt deeply.Furthermore, we observed what seemed to be selective attention where certain guests received preferential treatment while others, including ourselves, felt overlooked. This inconsistency in guest treatment is not only contrary to the principles of hospitality but also incredibly disheartening, as it suggests a disparity in service based on arbitrary distinctions.This encounter left us reflecting on the essence of luxury hospitality and how it is manifested through guest interactions. The service, which could be described as distant and unengaging, contrasted sharply with our delightful experiences at the Fullerton, where the service warmth and breakfast variety were remarkable.Given our latest experience, we have decided that for our future visits to Singapore, the FSS will not be our accommodation of choice. Our decision is influenced by not just the service discrepancies but also by our expectations of convenience for shopping at nearby locations like ION and Takashimaya, which, in hindsight, did not offset our overall hotel experience.In sharing our feedback, we hope it serves as constructive insight for the hotel to enhance its service quality, ensuring that all guests receive the warm, attentive, and personalized experience synonymous with luxury hospitality, without exceptions.",

We wouldnt have known that as it was indicated in very small letters on the box . A very thoughtful gift from Four seasons I must say! GPS also told us the the appetiser wasnt radish as we thought but pickled mango. Just when we were going to ask for more of the pickled mango, she appeared with extras served to us!

            "review_content": "My husband and I have just had an amazing stay in this excellent hotel. We chose a Club Room and enjoyed the benefits of the Club Lounge where we were greeted with such warmth and hospitality. All the team in the Club Lounge, Xavier, Ridhwar, Sean, Owen, Sakina, Jai and Miku looked after us so very well. I hope we havent left anyone out. We enjoyed our time with them so much. The hotel itself is elegant and luxurious and well maintained. Our room was nicely appointed and serviced regularly and well. We enjoyed the adults only pool although there is a separate family pool available. The only fault we could find is that the pool is rather cold but I believe thats often the case in Singapore. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore and look forward to coming back soon.",

            "review_content": "Four Seasons at Orchard is definitely one of the best hotels Ive lived in. Not only are the rooms large in comparison to other city hotels, this hotel gives you an Uber luxurious experience in terms of the property and hospitality.As we were landing much earlier than regular check in timings, we had requested for an early check in, which we got about 20-25 minutes into our arrival to the hotel and they were accommodating for a late check out by an hour, which was much appreciated!The hotel has two pools and theyre both pretty amazing! The jacuzzi is great, except the water was really dirty so this is the only minus there was to this hotel.The location of the hotel is spot on with most things within a distance of ~15 minutes by cab, 20-25 minutes by MRT (orchard MRT station was a ~2 min walk) and everything you would want to shop for, available at walking distance.The bed was large, luxurious and the amenities in the room were top notch. The housekeeping staff were also amazing because we would come back to the room in perfect condition and theyve gone above and beyond for us, to organise our room or provide for the things we needed during our stay. Special mention to Jess from the housekeeping team, who was so thoughtful and kind!The staff at the bell desk were so kind and helpful and deserve a mention too! We didnt have any meals here so I wont be commenting much on that but I can say that the restaurants seemed very popular! If youre looking for a hotel in Singapore, look no further! Four Seasons at Orchard wont disappoint. Thank you for your amazing hospitality! We loved our stay with you and cant wait to be back again!",

We arrived early, and were thrilled to be offered an early check-in by Gigi! She was super helpful and kind. Thank you Gigi! The rooms and bathrooms have been renovated, and have a fresh look. We loved the view from our room overlooking Orchard Blvd. The service was always fantastic. We enjoyed the pool and spa. The hotel is located a quick walk away from Orchard Road and have easy access to the Malls and Restaurants. We stayed during Christmas, and the hotel and Singapore in general have a lovely Christmassy atmosphere. We absolutely loved our stay here, and looking forward to returning!",

            "review_content": "I am breaking this into sections to give a fully detailed, honest and useful review of the Four Seasons Singapore.Overall my stay was amazing. This was my first trip to the hotel. I will continue to come back! I am considering booking with Four Season's exclusively moving forward given the the brands consistency across it's properties (looking forward to staying in their Koh Samui location next week!)Location: 5 star: The property is located in Singapore's Orchard district, located on Orchard Road, steps away from Singapores top shopping centers. You are moments away from any and all types of cuisines (Singapore, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, American, Italian, French you name it.) It is about a 25 minute taxi ride from Changi airport. The Orchard MRT station is also located right next door to the hotel, making all of Singapore conveniently accessible . Check in: 5 star: This was a memorable hotel check in. My wife and I were here for the first night of our honeymoon across Southeast Asia, and had just gotten of a 19 hour flight from NYC. We arrived to the hotel around 7am on a Friday morning (1/12), and our room was ready for us. The reservations desk had reached out to me a few days prior to arrival asking for our arrival details, and they went above and beyond to accommodate an early check in. Never in my life has a hotel checked us in this early without charge. The receptionist was warm and friendly, and the bellman promptly brought our luggage to the room within moments of us going upstairs. Note the hotel cannot guarantee an early check in, and we would not expect or demand one; this courtesy of Four Season's highlights the brand's excellence. The Room: 5 star:We booked the most basic, resort room for our stay. We were considering paying for an upgrade but nothing was available. In hindsight am glad we didn't upgrade since the basic room was already amazing enough! For a basic resort room at the Four Seasons, you are already outdoing most suites at other properties. It's aprox 500 square feet, with an incredibly comfortable bed, small living area with day bed/tables/chairs, flat screen television, and super large bathroom with tub, shower, dual vanity and separate toilette area. The Nespresso maker, smart lighting system and automatic curtains were nice touches.Spa: 5 star: We booked an appointment, amazing massage. The facilities are top notch. Steam room/sauna, showers, pool, and hot tub. I love how they only open the pool area to hotel guests to avoid overcrowding.Staff/ Service/activities : 5 star. The staff are what make the Four seasons special. Every employee is friendly, personable and well trained. They genuinely care for all guests. I have stayed in 5 star hotels where high rollers and suite holders are given preferential treatment, but even with a basic resort room I was given a premium service experience. The bellmen are helpful and prompt. Special shout out to the concierge who kindly helped",

Breakfast was particularly enjoyable and whilst we didn't eat in any of the restaurants, we did enjoy cocktails in the ground floor bar. With only two nights, we focused on getting out and about and the hotel is well located to Orchard Road and the shopping precinct. Offering two pool areas was a plus, a quiet 3rd floor pool offering for adults only and the rooftop pool area for all including families. This is something we appreciated as young families can make it hard to relax around a pool. Beds were not especially comfortable but the pillows and sheets were fabulous. Would certainly recommend for a brief stopover but for a longer term stay, the location has less to offer.",

            "review_content": "We had a 2-night stay here traveling with family. We had reserved two rooms and they were kind enough to assign us rooms next door to each other. That was very helpful as we were traveling with two older parents.I stayed here last in 2019 and they have made some substantial improvements to the fitness area. I really loved the new gym, it's a huge step up from the old gym that felt cramped and leftover. I still love the lap pool. It's quiet, surrounded by greenery and a lovely place to spend a bit of time. It's also one of the best lap pools of any hotel I've seen in Singapore and I appreciate it's separate from the family pool on the top floor.Rooms are the same as I remember - spacious, comfortable and excellent bathroom. I love the shower at this hotel as it's big and easy to get in/out. We had breakfast both mornings in the buffet. I might be mis-remembering, but I feel like the quality and variety of food offerings has declined since my last stay. I remember a more extensive buffet before that included a wider variety of fresh fruit, some local items like Kaya toast and Indian and Indonesian items. Now it's more limited and felt like a quality downgrade. Many of the hot items were served lukewarm, especially the yum cha (dim sum). It was enough to get the day started but we were not particularly excited about the spread.Service at this hotel is of course the best Four Seasons has to offer. Friendly, warm and personal without being fussy. I still think this hotel is a great option in Singapore, especially if you need to be on Orchard Road. It's quiet, comfortable and feels like a retreat from the business of Orchard.",

As always, the service is excellent and top notch. Each staff greets me by name and welcomes me with so much heart. I feel very loved and pampered here. I must commend most especially Muz of the concierge who handled all my restaurant reservations at the top Michelin restaurants as early as five months before I arrived and who snagged me Burnt Ends. His knowledge of all the local hangouts and places to dine is incomparable. I must also commend Jumain for his service and hospitality. He welcomed me when my family arrived late on our first night and warmly greeted me and handled my requests everyday thereafter. I also commend Ronald at the pool who always welcomes me when I am here and takes care of my kids when they swim. He greets and takes time to talk to me in our native tongue Tagalog. Finally, our housekeeper Ma Wan was very efficient and friendly. She cleaned our two rooms very meticulously and thoroughly. She made sure my son had his tea bags and our favorite Nordac water and she replenished my sons bubble bath every night. This is my home away from home. Christmas at the four seasons is magical.",

            "review_content": "This is an OUTSTANDING hotel with amazing food. Of note, my husband travels to Singapore between 4-6 times a year for work and we always stay here. In the past, I have not had the breakfast buffet, but this time we opted for it. Let me tell you, it is so well done. I have stayed at 20+ Four Seasons hotels around the world, Cheval Blanc, O&O, Airelles, Ritz, St. Regis, etc. and it is worth noting how good this breakfast buffet is. They try to incorporate the local foods in the back area of the breakfast buffet by the kitchen. It is not the type of buffet that has 1000s of different types of foods but it has a very well coordinated and is very well thought through selection of high quality foods. The jams are from France (I asked), the fruit is imported from Australia and other areas. My recommendation (if you are Western/from the Americas/UK/Australia)- pass by the front part of the buffet with the usual breads and cheeses and forgo the eggs and pancakes and go for the back to try the Asian foods. (I apologize to all the Asian people who read this review and roll their eyes- to be fair though, my husband is Asian and he eats mostly western foods and doesnt like to really explore food wise) They have a Chinese/Singaporean/Indian section with foods that rotate. I found this buffet particularly unique because I havent seen some of the selection of foods they offer at other places- so I asked and it turns out that they use recipes from the Chefs own families. I hate to say that I dont eat congee that often, but the Exec chef, Patrick helped me put together a very delicious bowl and I couldnt be happier. Also, stop by Chef Roslies place in the center of the breakfast buffet where he prepares his own Singaporean recipes from his family. The Mee Rebus was great and every day it changes.I will say that I love this hotel and the staff is always so kind and amazing to me and my husband (thank you, Cara, for your kind hospitality towards us). My husband plays tennis wherever we go around the world so we stay at this hotel vs. other hotels in Singapore (although I have stayed at the Mandarin and St. Regis in the past in Singapore) due to the access to the tennis courts and coaches. For me, I like to lap swim and the pool outside is perfect and has lanes. I appreciated that a lot. Nobu on site was excellent. I will say I have more limited comparisons for this Nobu vs. a lot of them in the US, and I will say that I preferred the Nobu here. It just opened a few years ago I think. It is great and easy choice for dinner one night. Overall, I dont particularly love to write these reviews but Chef Patrick, Chef Pierre, and the rest",

            "review_content": "It's not much to look at from the outside, so I was expecting a bit of a classic corporate experience from Four Seasons. So it was unexpectedly delightful, when spending 4 days in Singapore with my husband on our first 'empty nest' holiday, to find that the Four Seasons offered great hospitality, nicely attentive service, good breakfast, excellent housekeeping. And two pools, including a lovely rooftop pool. And an amazing gym. On a city break, we wouldn't normally spend much time at the hotel, but the Four Seasons was so comfortable, that when we needed a couple of hours to rest between outings, we were very happy to just chill out in our room, which was a good size,, well furnished, with great bathroom. The concierge team and front of house 'meet & greet' deserve a particular mention, they are excellent, friendly and helpful. And a great location for the MRT and for shopping. Well done.",

Thank you, Navin!As \"Executive Club\" guests, we were treated to complimentary drinks and snacks in the Waterfall Lounge each evening. While all the staff in the lounge were great, we would like to mention Iskander and Chan in particular.Iskander was extremely pleasant and chatty and made sure we wanted for nothing.However, it was young Chan who impressed us greatly with his enthusiasm for his duties. Full of energy, hard working and a smile on his face at all times. Good luck in your hospitality studies, Chan. Thank you for looking after us so well.At the front desk, Lee Mei gave us helpful advice on a cultural matter. Kenji helped us with our luggage and Hershiel checked us out efficiently.We'd like to thank everyone. We hope to stay again next time we visit Singapore.",

            "review_content": "I am currently staying at here for an indefinite period, and I must say, it has been an outstanding experience from the second week onwards. One of the standout aspects of my stay is the exceptional hospitality provided by the hotel manager, Jesslyn Chong.From the second week of our stay, Jesslyn Chong has gone above and beyond to ensure our comfort and satisfaction. Her professionalism is evident in every interaction, always greeting us with a warm smile and a genuine interest in how our stay is going. She has taken the time to understand our needs and preferences, making personalized recommendations that have greatly enhanced our experience.The hotel itself is immaculate, with well-appointed rooms and amenities. However, it is the little touches and the personal attention from Jesslyn that truly make our stay memorable. She ensure that any special requests are promptly attended to, Jesslyn demonstrates an unwavering commitment to providing top-notch service.One particular instance that stands out was when there was a gap in our booking dates that had not been updated. This oversight could have left my husband without a room for the day. However, Jesslyn personally stepped in to help. She promptly reset the access card and personally escorted my husband to ensure he would not be roomless for the day. This thoughtful and efficient handling of the situation made us feel incredibly valued as guests and highlighted Jesslyn's dedication to creating memorable experiences.Throughout our stay, we have experienced a few blackouts and several instances where the television was not working. On one occasion, a technician was sent to check the issue but could not determine the reason for the malfunction or repair it. Jesslyn then personally called us to offer a change to another room, ensuring we wouldn't be inconvenienced further. The new room was perfect, and everything worked great, showcasing her commitment to guest satisfaction.Additionally, while the breakfast buffet offers a variety of items, we found that the majority of the dishes were quite salty. This was a bit disappointing as it limited our options, especially for a prolonged stay. We hope that the kitchen staff can adjust the seasoning to cater to a wider range of tastes.On several occasions, I called in to request items like an extra blanket, and the hotel staff attended to my requests promptly and professionally. This level of service significantly contributed to the overall comfort and satisfaction of our stay.In summary, my indefinite stay at Genting Hotel Jurong has been exceptional, thanks to the exemplary hospitality of Jesslyn Chong from the second week onwards. Her professionalism, attentiveness, and genuine care for guests set a high standard that other hotels should aspire to. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone seeking a comfortable and memorable stay, and I extend my deepest gratitude to Jesslyn Chong for making our time here so enjoyable.Thank you, Jesslyn, and the entire team at Genting Hotel Jurong, for an unforgettable experience. We look forward to continuing our stay.",

I would say it's a great place for tourists who are here for ultimate food, shopping and cultural experience. It was indeed a delightful experience for us even though we reside in Singapore. The room was beautifully decorated in black and white hues and had a smart control panel for the room's lights and air-conditioning. The reading light by the side of the bed was touch-sensored so it was really convenient and thoughtful!The bed was soft and comfy. Pillows were slim pillows but we were shocked that they gave us a good sleep nonetheless! Bathtub was big enough and removing the blinds allowed one to watch TV from the comfort of the bath tub. There was also a ceiling fan in the room. The closet can be opened from the bathroom side as well which made it really convenient! However one drawback was there was no vanity table or area for hair drying or makeup purposes. Service at the crystal club lounge was fantastic. We especially enjoyed the evening cocktail; the beef stew and the mushroom penne was amazing. Commendable service from a lady staff (Kriya, hope I didn't spell her name wrongly) and Thomas. They took time to engage with guests making them feel at home. Concierge staff were also always polite and on hand to assist too. All in, it was a fantastic experience.",

I loved the room and the location. Being genuinely kind and appreciative of the hotel team goes such a long way!Unfortunately, I forgot the manager's name of the bellmen, but he and all the other bellmen were fantastic! Also, Ally, who was my housekeeper, was so nice and always had a really great attitude and smile! I loved seeing her in the hallway whenever I was coming or going. You can walk to Boat Quay, Clarke Quay or Marina Bay within minutes. Great shopping and plenty of places to eat! If you want to jump on the MRT, it's just a few short minutes away.Loved it so much, I just booked a room again, this time with Club Lounge access.The Club has a nice selection of food and drinks and a really nice outdoor deck to relax and catch a view of the area.

His patience and professionalism enable me to book a stay cation for my family.Reception upon checked in was very friendly. Pleasant and everything was perfect for us. Less than 5 minutes walk to Centre point and Orchard Central. A good 10 minutes walk to Plaza Singapura. Convenient !!A Big shout out to Ms Lisa of housekeeping. Very cheerful and hardworking!! Ms Mina, a very sweet young lady at dinning for dinner . Definitely recommendable was their Pan Fried Salmon and Nasi Lemak ( chilli was fiery hot )My boys had a splendid time at the poolside. No poolside dinning was a letdown to them. Kids usually liked to have a quick bite and popped back to pool.Checking out was smooth and fast. As usual the warmth hospitality at the front desk marked the end of our stay cation, a very happy and memorable one.Thank you to all the staff!!From the Siew Family Room 529",

Infact was told earest would be 1.00PM.Paid extra to get into a holding room and miraculously the originally booked room BECAME available at 10.45 Am.

It was a double standard room which had sufficient space to store big luggage as well as comfortable for 2 adults+2 kids.The room was quite well maintained with all needed amenities. The location of the hotel is also a plus point considering the presence of many shopping malls, department stores and accessibility to the 2 mrt stations which are less than 10 min walk from the hotel. The main advantage of the hotel is the good breakfast spread which also includes a live counter. It had good number of of options for vegetarians as well. We stayed for 3 nights and only on one day we had to wait for about 8 minutes to get seated which was still ok considering the weekend crowd. The staff in the restaurant were also quite courteous and helpful. The pool at the terrace was also very well maintained with hygiene. Overall i would rate the hotel a very good value for the money and would recommend it for all families visiting Singapore.",

Particularly, the Executive Lounge is becoming a kindergarten for family and kids. I mean, come on kids in there PJs in an Executive Lounge!Hotel decor outdated but holds some class still. Food quality dropped and supplemented with cheaper types of food. Executive Lounge serves cheap quality labelled wines and spirits.

            "review_content": "We arrived early morning at this hotel after getting off a cruise ship in Singapore and stayed for four days. With our early arrival, it was no surprise we were not able to get into our room immediately. The lovely young woman at check-in who assured us that we would be able to get into the room within a couple of hours, suggested we go and explore Orchard Rd and that as soon as the room was available, our luggage would be put into our room. Taking her suggestion, we did exactly this. Orchard Rd. is only a block away and so we took advantage of the time and did some exploring.Upon returning to the hotel about 90 minutes later, we were greeted by the same young lady at check-in, who advised that our room was ready, and had been upgraded to a better view, overlooking the Prime Minister's residence's grounds and that our luggage had been taken to the room. We had purchased a Premium Room as we knew that it had lounge access, but didn't know exactly what this entailed. The room was spacious, with a lovely view and had all of the usual amenities. What we discovered, from the lovely woman at check-in, is this meant it offered a private lounge for breakfast and happy hour. The breakfast was fulsome, with a great selection of North American and Asian offerings. The happy hour offered an amazing selections of foods and plenty of drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. However, what made this so special, was the kind and considerate staff - Dyn, Jack, Fiona and all of the others who supported this lounge. They just took amazing care of us each morning and each evening! By the time we left after our four day stay, we felt like family. The hotel's pool was delightful, set on the hotel roof, sheltered with a large umbrella and very comfy chairs/ottomans and loungers. The pool was refreshing after a long day of exploring Singapore. To be honest, this wasn't our first choice of hotel in Singapore. However, due to increasing hotel room costs, it was the one that we selected. I am so grateful that our chosen hotel raised their room rates and we found this gem! From the time that we entered the hotel, until the time of departure, with the concierge taking care of arranging our taxi to the airport, we felt pampered and welcomed by their amazing staff! Thanks you for your wonderful hospitality!!",

Truly one of the best breakfasts anywhere! Great service, chef doing eggs/omelettes and pancakes/waffles to order.. large assortments of hot dishes, breads, pastries, cold dishes, cereals. Really impressive! We also used room service option from in house restaurant on 2nd floor. Ordered and I actually picked food up, very convenient. Great food and very reasonably priced! Front desk staff and concierge very helpful and accommodating. They organized cab pick up for 0430 on day we left and it worked perfectly! Our stay on 7th floor was very quiet, room very clean and comfortable. Wed definitely stay here again when visiting Singapore..",

            "review_content": "This hotel's strengths and weaknesses were more or less as I expected from the reviews and location. Having been to Singapore several times already, we wanted someplace that was not a typical Western hotel in a typical tourist location, and this fit the bill. The neighborhood is fun to wander around in, with plenty of restaurants and local shops with interesting and colorful architecture That being said, it is not very central, and it took a slow $30 SGD Grab ride to get to the Gardens by the Bay area, which was too crowded to enjoy anyway so next time we'll skip it.The hotel itself was a nicely designed conversion of a local building, with plenty of character and ambience. Rooms are not huge, though ours had a nice interior balcony and spacious shower. Wish they had more rooms with bathtub available. Nice little box of chocolate as a welcome gift, maybe due to IHG status. Bed was comfy and most importantly the AC worked well but overall it is not a super high end room, but design touches were quite.Breakfast at Baba Chew's was pretty good but on the modest side; a very small buffet with limited choices for vegetarians though they did offer a nice a la carte paratha and dal dish that was not on the menu. Just don't expect a big five star buffet like you will get in the larger hotels.Front desk was friendly and helpful with any requests. Overall this is an interesting place to stay in an interesting neighborhood; just understand what you're signing up for. If uniqueness and character (as well as pretty good value) are more important than luxury for you then this place fits the bill.",

The only gripe I have is the smokers corner at the pet-friendly dining area of Baba Chew. On both days when we had our breakfast, we had to put up with the smoke and smell of cigarette and cigar smokers albeit for a short while. In fact, is smoking allowed at such close proximity of other diners?",

I highly recommend Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong to everyone. Their breakfast is amazing, and the rooftop is peaceful and beautiful.

            "review_content": "We stayed in the Intercontinental Singapore on our way to Europe in late April for three days and on our way home for three days in late June. There are hundreds of hotels in Singapore and I have stayed in many of them including the Hilton, Four Seasons, St Regis and Marriott. All are good but we found to our surprise that the Intercontinental was wonderful. First a hotel is its people and we found everyone friendly and more than expert in their roles and they seemed to genuinely care we were there which for a big chain hotel is surprising. Then the Hotel itself is so different from most hotels. The decor is Peranakan (Singaporean) in keeping with its location in the historic district of Singapore. The halls and Lobby are not the normal boring beige and browns of most hotels but stylishly colonial with cabinets displaying antique Peranakan ceramics and the picture collection likewise reflected Singapore culture. The upstairs corridors were beautiful with an enfilade of pillars as you looked down the corridor. And the rooms were large with nice big bathrooms, the rooms were all well appointed with a comfortable bed, loads of storage space and beautiful well maintained furniture. There are I think 6 restaurants in the Hotel and we dined in two of them the food portions were very large and the choices huge. The food was delicious and not too expensive. If you get bored with dining options at the Hotel or of you need something from a chemists or a supermarket the hotel is connected by a door off the lobby to the Bugis Junction Shopping Centre so you do not have to leave the air-conditioning to shop.My recommendation is to book rooms with access to the lounge. Not only is this one of the most beautiful lounges I have ever seen but the staff are highly attentive and always remember you with a friendly hello. The lounge offers a breakfast, afternoon tea and evening drinks. There is a small buffet at each but with each offering there is a menu so at breakfast you can order a variety of freshly cooked hot foods, at afternoon tea usually some kind of treat and in the evening hot canapes again freshly cooked and always a delicious bowl of nourishing soup! The drinks available in the evening were extensive too. The hotel is one block from Raffles, close to Clerk Quay and the historic district and no more than a $10 cab fare from either Orchard Rd or Marina Bay Sands. It was an ideal base from which to explore Singapore. We all agreed it was one of the nicest hotels we had stayed in on our trip and so different for a large chain hotel in that it was beautifully decorated and the staff always made you feel like you just belonged there, We will be back.",

Amazing well designed facilities for better living experience from lobby area, lobby lounge, rooms and specially the lounge. Great food selections in the club lounge specially breakfast and dinner. Superb services from the club lounge instantly recognized your food preferences specially for me im in low sodium diet. Room upgrade to highest floor with amazing view of Bugis area and indeed it has spacious place compared to those othe hotels I had in Singapore and very comfortable bed.Location are perfect for shoppers hotel directly connected to Bugis Junction shopping center and also for food lovers it has plenty of restaurants options all over the places in Bugis area. My main concern was the way the staff communicated their Ambassadors Guest. Ive been receiving daily emails asking hows my stay while I was still in the hotel. I would suggest to let their staff be more physically engaged during stay with their guest rather than sending regular emails. Club lounge was best place to meet and have short talk.Overall this hotel can give you the very best five star experience during stay in Singapore. Definitely a place to consider always to return during my next visit.",

The actual event went flawlessly. The food (a 7 course Chinese banquet prepared by Chinese Chef Orlando and his team) was absolutely sublime, with matching wines. The room and table decor was exquisitely prepared with the specified floral arrangements, crockery. Special thanks to Jun Yi for helping set the sound and television equipment for our band. The serving staff (Boon Wee, Mugilan & Nazri) were discreet and professional in promptly delivering the plates to our guests (ably orchestrated by Andry the banquet manager) and ensuring glasses of wine and soft drink were filled. The wedding cake was skilfully created by Pastry Chef Jason according to our specification and was delicious, with delicate spongecake layers (vanilla and chocolate), buttercream icing and decorated with gold shavings. The entire event was our dream come true.",

We loved the more traditional feel of the intercontinental but also the familiar modern touches and smells from our other intercontinental stays elsewhere. As many have said the welcome was warm from the delightful doormen to the reception team and the breakfast room staff. We arrived very early and after a coffee in the breakfast room our room was ready at 9am for which we were very grateful. The bed was extremely comfortable the room was spacious. We used the gym, the rooftop pool and had a drink in the peaceful lobby lounge. The breakfast buffet was excellent, so many choices and delicious food. Great location- we walked easily to Marina Bay, got the MRT to and from the Bugis station - the hotel is connected to the mall. We left planning to come back and would definitely stay again.",

Was checked in by Gabriel, with his most amicable and heartwarming hospitality services. He gave detailed information and was extremely helpfully throughout the stay. Manager Khazlynn and Rebecca were also very outstanding and customer service oriented. Thanks to them for the well elite recognition provided and the room arrangement made.The entire stay was perfect. Clean spacious room assigned, the Executive lounge was another key highlight too. The service provided by Renz was excellent, along with a good variety of drinks and servings. Highly recommended to stay here when you're in Singapore.",

Everyone went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and we had a fabulous time. The front desk people were great, the concierge made fabulous arrangements for us. The Fish Pool and Syrena, was a real treat and with food to match. Jeini and Freddie in the lounge made us feel as though we were staying with family. Ebb and Flow are surely some of the most luxurious pools anywhere in the World. I simply cant praise the hotel and its staff highly enough.",

Wilbur took the time to find out what foods we Iiked and made an extensive list of places to eat.If you have elite status and have access to the executive lounge, it is tremendous. The food is top restaurant quality. The service is high-end restuarant quality. The staff is super friendly and attentive to all your needs. This is by far the best executive lounge I've experienced.From the front deck to house-kepping the staff is friendly and professional. They work really hard to ensure you have a great experience at their hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel.",

Their buffet breakfast was delicious, Aliff provided excellent and professional service.Their pool on 18th floor has incredible views of the whole city and a connecting bar and their pool on 6th floor in East Tower is beautiful and naturally warmed. My daughter taught herself to swim here, so it's great to have this memory in such a special place.Kelvin the pool attendant is a gentleman! He lent our daughters some floaties which made their pool experience even more special.Location is beautiful, close to shops and attractions of SG!We will return for sure!",

            "review_content": "Had my wedding at JW Marriot South Beach and it was the most memorable night for my wife and I! Chanel Tan was our event manager and she was helpful throughout the process (from signing of contract till end of event). On the wedding night, the crew behind the scene, mainly Eshan (Banquet in-charge), Maran (2nd in-charge), Eugene (AV), Chef Raymond and his kitchen team were exceptional and kept the show running like clockwork. As our irresponsible wedding planner (The Wedding Concepteur) quit on us 2 months before our wedding, we had to coordinate everything by ourselves. Eshan was extremely helpful briefed us thoroughly and made sure that the banquet went smoothly and assisted us throughout the evening. He also checked on us and kept us calm before the march-in, reassuring that everything will go smoothly as everything was quite hectic. The guests all complimented how good the food were - we were glad that Chef Raymond and team maintained the consistency. What we had during the food tasting was what was delivered on the very day. It became one of the most memorable evenings of our lives and the efforts were all worth it. The hotel stay was also very pleasant for us and our guests who came overseas.Thank you very much to the JW Marriot crew for the great experience! Calvin & Samantha 18 May 2024",

My wife and I celebrated a wedding anniversary while we were here, and thanks to Kelly and the rest of the Guest Relations team, this was a special stay to remember. In particular, Kelly was very helpful and responsive to prepare the room in advance of our arrival, including helping to receive a floral delivery and ensuring it was placed in the room ahead of time. The property is superb, including our daily breakfasts at the Executive Lounge. Location is good as well as its walking distance to 3 different MRT lines (with only about 2-3 minutes of the walk outside with the rest inside). Thanks again to everyone at JW Marriott for helping to make our stay incredible!",

Her attention to detail is unparalleled. Despite our extensive travel experience, I have never encountered someone so meticulous. She noticed I wear glasses and thoughtfully left special cleaning towels for them. She took exceptional care of everything during our stay.A special mention also goes to Sous-chef Daniel Teo.

The cleanliness of the rooms was impeccable, and the little touches made the celebration truly unforgettable. To top it off, there was champagne waiting for my mother-in-law and wine for my brother-in-law. The presence of cakes, balloons, and personalized greeting cards for each celebrant added a special touch to the occasion.The attention to detail and thoughtful gestures from the hotel staff made our stay truly memorable.

Luxury guest rooms with very good amenities including spa facilities. Just not to stay in those rooms facing the courtyard as the sound proof is not so good, music from the bars during night time is quite annoying. Luckily, the hotel able to change another room for me on the other side of the tower and things went better. Spacious Spa with very relaxing environment, no other guest using the Spa at noon during the weekday in my stay, free to use other facilities in the spa such as the jacuzzi after my massage treatment.Two swimming pools in the hotel and I prefer the one in the lower tower with better seatings along the pool.Could try one of the restaurants in the hotel - Arika Back. Japanese fusion food with bit of Korean taste, bit spicy. Better to ask for recommendation from the staff and think they can offer the best to suit your taste. Personally like \"AB Wagyu Tacos\" and \"Perfect Storm\"Generally a pleasant stay.",

            "review_content": "Before I visited the JW Marriott, I explained that I am 99% blind and will require some assistance at breakfast and whilst in the executive lounge. I also like quite a specific breakfast and asked if they can arrange this for me with this advance notice. The hotel has 2 towers. Tain tower and East Tower. The East Tower mainly has studio rooms and the remaining room categories including suites are in the Main Tower. There are a total of 634 rooms with about 47 suites. Marriott Bonvoy Elite members (Platinum, Titanium and Ambassadors) can access the club lounge. Elite members will need to have their breakfast in the lounge otherwise they will need to pay a surcharge if they want to eat at the main restaurant. Normally the cost is $45++ for adults, children aged 6-12 pay half price and elite members get a small discount and pay $35++ (this may vary as it is a promotion). On arrival, I was checked in by Sabrina Lau who was thorough and very accommodating to my needs (being registered blind). I should mention that I am an Marriott Bonvoy Ambassador Elite member and received a complimentary upgrade to a beautiful corner Suite! Take a look on YouTube at love flying and hotels. I was also offered a late check out but declined as I had a special flight booked from Singapore to London in Singapore Airlines First Class Suites at 09:00am and you can also check this out on YouTube soon. I was also offered a welcome gift, local snacks or 1,000 bonus points. I chose points. My room was 796 square feet or 74 square metres. It really was stunning. I then explored the hotel starting off with the executive lounge. This lounge is probably the best lounge in the world in terms of value for money and also had excellent service! The reason why I say it is the best lounge is because they serve breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails and light bites. This may seem familiar with other lounges BUT, there is far more variety and the premium items. For example, at breakfast they had blueberries and at evening cocktails they had Makers Mark (bourbon), Chivas Regal and normally they serve Tiger beer but despite running out of this, they served Peroni! They could have just said they are out of beer although this wouldnt go down very well!There are 2 towers and 2 pools! This is nice in case one pool was too busy! They were also games like ping pong, pool and table football. There are a number of upscale restaurants and bars, live music, mermaid show and more, so you will have plenty to do for a good few days! I would definitely revisit and I recommend a try!",

The staff are generally over professional, caring, and ready to go any length to provide clients with more customised and personalised needs. The Gym instructor (called Malcom) on duty took his time to sit me down to give me lectures on appropriate exercise routines to meet my needs. He actually provided me with notes on these, and by the time I returned for my next Gym visit, he had already mentioned me and my needs to his colleagues at the Gym to assist me on that day, and other days he will not be at work. On one of such visits, I had a terrible stomach upset during my work out and vomited just at the entrance to the Gym. Honestly, I was expecting angry staff approaching me on what I did, but to my surprise, the Recreational Centre Supervisor himself (Andrew Lau), Rose and a Security Officer on duty came to help me up on my feet as I was lying on the floor. They constantly asked me if I was okay and needed to be taken to a medical officer. I insisted that I was fine, and they cleaned up the place and took me to my room to see me settle in. The next day, I was served a letter by the Hotel Manager, to check on my well-being and to ask me to either call the front desk and come over to see the staff just so that they can see me physically and confirm that I was okay. In addition to this, a large pan of assorted fruits and coconut drink was served to my room (free of charge) to help me recover. This experience, plus the conduciveness of the Hotel, make my stay there heavingly!",

            "review_content": "My Uncle & I visited Singapore on a 2-day stop-over, on our way to Siem Reap, Cambodia. My Uncle hasn't been to Singapore in over 30 years, so I decided to stay splurge and stay for 2 nights at the most iconic hotel in Singapore. We arrived at the hotel by taxi from Changi airport at around 11.30am. The doormen helped us to take our luggage from the trunk of our taxi the minute our taxi pulled up at the front entrance of Tower 1. We were then escorted to the check-in counter and there wasn't any queue at all that morning! While we were in the process of checking in, a friendly staff member came around to offer all the arriving guests complimentary bottles of drinking water and Chuppa-chupps lollipops(a popular candy in Asia)! I have traveled around the world, never before has any hotel or resort ever offered their new guests Chuppa-chupps candy!!! As per our booking, we were allocated a twin-bed room on a high floor with a view of the Gardens by the Bay. The check-in process was completed in 7-minutes and our room was ready right away! No need to wait until 3pm like some other previous guests had lamented.The room was magnificent, clean, comfortable and spacious, with all the amenities you would expect from a 5-star hotel, plus breathtaking views from the ENORMOUS balcony! This was the first time that we have seen a sofa set(a 3-seater & 2 single seaters) on a hotel room balcony!!! The room also included complimentary mini bar drinks and snacks, which will be replenished once a day during the housekeeping service. We could also request for additional bottles of drinking water, which we did, because we spent a fair bit of time walking around Singapore and the weather here is hot & humid.The world-famous infinity edge swimming pool is as spectacular as all the photos on social media has portrayed! We were fortunate that on the day we took a dip in the iconic swimming pool, it wasn't overcrowded and we managed to get some great photos from this facility. Guests will be given 2 pool towels & a bottle of drinking water upon registering to enter the pool. IMPORTANT NOTE: Each guest has to hold 1 individual key card which was issued by the check-in counter upon checking into the hotel, in order to be allowed to enter and use the swimming pool. If you are a couple who are traveling together, both of you have to produce an in-house hotel room key card each, in order to enter the pool. The management has to be very stringent with everyone who wants to enter the swimming pool because in the past, some outsiders have tried various ways to sneak into the iconic swimming pool. The famous botanical garden called Gardens By the Bay is connected to this hotel. We took a stroll to the Super Tree Grove to take some photos but we didn't enter the Cloud",

That aside, the room was comfortable, the staff were polite and the amenities were great. I recommend using the infinity pools at sunrise as the space is next empty and the views are phenomenal.

The bathroom and changing area is cleaner than my own bathroom (which is saying something). They offer complimentary amenities to freshen up. Lastly, the staff were incredibly helpful and attentive throughout my visit. They offered to get me water, make me coffee, and even provided a mat for me.

He was very helpful and friendly. All in all the staff around the hotel were excellent. It is a massive hotel/ shopping mall which has the infamous infinity pool ( a must do whatever the weather). The Gardens by the Bay were spectacular, although one night the lights were not dancing to music- technical glitch, but you may not know that of it's your first time there! The Banyan Tree SPA is luxurious and Ce LA ViE rooftop is magic. Definitely go there! A heads up, you have to be a guest staying at the hotel to access the infinity pool and sky bats:)",

I treated my parents for their 50th wedding anniversary reminiscing their memories many many years ago. They used to live and had their wedding in Singapore. My father was not keen on height so my mother stayed in their rooms when we went to the infinity pool and enjoyed the fantastic panoramic view of Singapore from the roof top. Quite blowy at night so gave a bit or relieve to the hot temperature (30ish Celsius)",

The team truly do go above and beyond to make your stay as memorable as possible. We received a message from the Premium Service Team on the morning of check-in. They arranged a complimentary pick-up service, and upon check-in we were told that we had been upgraded. As it was our honeymoon the team had left a bouquet of flowers, balloons, a cake and bottle of wine in our room to celebrate! They made the stay feel so incredibly special and we cant thank the team (especially Eunice) enough for helping make our stay so memorable.Aside from the exemplary service, the room was spacious and packed with amenities that just made us feel at home. Finally the pool is soo incredibly special. The views are stunning and we happily spent most of the day soaking in the sights and relaxing.The Marina Bay Sands is iconic and staying exceeded all our expectations.",

The pool is only available to hotel guests.Big queues at the roof top bar.The evening sunset is unforgettable.Clean and tidy.Within easy walking distance of the main city, great views of the F1 track.We did a pedal bike guided tour, worth every penny as they take you through the back streets.Would stay again.",

We were very impressed by the quality of food served in the lounge especially the pastries/desserts which equal those made in Paris. Most impressive was the incredible service provided by Mr Malek, Joni and his most attentive & capable staff. They were so polite and welcoming and addressed all of our daily needs efficiently and with a huge smile. The very humble Mr Malek is truly the heart of the hotel as he provided us with a heartfelt card of appreciation when we left. He truly puts himself in the guests shoes to give the best service possible. The rest of the hotel staff were efficient & attentive too, especially the concierge team who helped us to order our taxis & help us with excess luggage requirements. It was a most pleasant stay, and we would thoroughly recommend staying at this hotel on the Skyline lounge level. We will definitely return as soon as we can! Thank you One Farrer Hotel!",

All hotels in Singapore are expensive, but at One Farrer you get much value for your money. A very big thank you to Ms Joo at reception: we arrived at Changi airport very early in the morning and therefore were at the hotel a long time before official check-in time. After leaving our luggage at the reception we went out to Gardens by the Bay and returned still early. Ms Joo found a way to give us a room - and even a very nice one at floor 18. A service far beyond what one could expect!If ever coming back to Singapore, I know what hotel to book",

Must mention that right from enquiring about the room to checking out from the Hotel, the experience was simply Outstanding. Everyone with whom we interacted with during our stay was simply awesome. The r Skyline Studio Family Room (No. 1832) was a huge 50 Sq mts, well enough for three adults and a child aged 6 year. The two-queen sized double beds were comfortable. The large glass window provided a fantastic view of Singapore. Our flight was delayed and by the time we checked in the hotel, it was well past 8pm. But having access to the Skyline Lounge, which is open till 10:30pm, we could get some refreshing tea and cookies. Post that we unpacked, freshened up and went for dinner. As we had gone to celebrate our daughters Birthday, Ms. Emily very kindly arranged for a Black Forest cake for her.Mr. Malek, managing the Sky Lounge was extremely courteous and went steps ahead to make the stay memorable. I also warmly acknowledge our interactions with Emily, Melivn, Nancy, Maytee, Vasan and all others (whose names I do not remember). Before I miss, the housekeeping too was impeccable. Overall, I must say that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at One Farrer. It is one of the Best Hotels, that we have stayed during our stay overseas. Sincere Thanks to everyone at One Farrer, for having made our stay Memorable.",

Other than having to wait an hour to check in but was provided with a free upgrade from the mint room to the mint premier room by the receptionist Narelp and Parma. However, one main issue was the amount of flies in the room, there were a couple of them on the blinds and a few around the room which was rather unsightly, hopefully the hotel will be able to improve with that. Paid for the room with breakfast included and even though the Escape restaurant was packed when we reached there at 9am, we were escorted to the Premier Lounge to have our breakfast instead and was greeted by the very friendly staff, Malek. Malek was very attentive and served us with beverage while we waited for a table to be available. My partner and I had a good time at the breakfast service on the both days we stayed and highly recommend Malek as a great staff!",

Our stay was incredibly enjoyable and comfortable, thanks to the warm welcome by the hotel team.We were especially touched by the special birthday cake arranged for my daughter's 9th birthday. It was a delightful surprise and made her day extra special. Additionally, the complimentary late check-out was greatly appreciated and allowed us to enjoy our stay a little longer without any rush.The warmth and hospitality we received at the Skyline Lounge were equally impressive. The staff's attentiveness and genuine care made us feel truly valued and added to the overall excellence of our experience.These thoughtful gestures made our stay truly memorable, and we will fondly remember our time at our favourite hotel. Thank you once again for the exceptional service! We look forward to returning later this year.",

Swimming pool is quite long,clean and climate controlled,open to sky...very soothing..Staff was very helpful especially Joo at reception and Vishnu at concierge.Joo not only gave us an early check-in,which I was least expecting and also gave top floor interconnected rooms with lovely view...Staff at reception was also helpful and ready answer our repeated questions too...In all,if ever I am again in Singapore.... One Farrer Hotel will be my home away from home...My only suggestion is to have more Indian vegetarian varieties in breakfast buffet,especially to have an Indian cook,not Chinese cook,to supervise the breakfast combos...Like on day 1 (7th June 2024) there was Dal Makhani,but no vegetarian rice... I almost took rice with duck... Also there was potato sabzi but no chapattis/naan... Ate potato with bread.. On day 2 (8th June 2024) there were Indian breads/naan but no Indian vegetarian sabzi/Dal... Ate naan with hash brownies...These are small lapses can be corrected easily if an Indian cook sets the menu... I will definitely give 5 star ratings..",

The room was still not available so we left our luggage first to go around the area.3. We came back at around 2pm. We were able to check-in already.4. We were happily suprised that they upgraded our room from mint room to skyline studio. We truly appreciate their kind gesture.5. The location is good. About 3 minute walk from hotel lobby to Farrer Park MRT station (North East Line). This station can get you to all best spots in the City. Very easy to transfer to other MRT lines as well.6. Walking distance to shops and restaurants around Little India. 7. 5 minute walk to Mustafa Centre and City Square Mall.8. 7-Eleven is just beside the hotel.9. The skyline studio room is very spacious. 10. Our room was cleaned daily. They replenish the toiletries and bottled water daily.11. Bed and pillows were very comfortable.12. Automatic curtain and blinds.13. TV was available with few channels and also a bluetooth speaker/radio.14. Wifi worked well.15. Bath robes and towels were fresh.16. Toilet has a water sprinkler bidet type which is okay. Our only issue with the toilet was its height. It is too high so when you sit on it, your feet are a bit hanging and not flat on the ground. I'm 5'8ft but only my toes were touching the floor.17. Hair blower, kettle, coffee maker, and fridge were all available in the room.18. Gym and pool at the 6th floor were huge.19. Security personnel were always present.20. All hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. Special thanks to Joo, Dana, and Param.21. We did not try their food so no comment on that.22. There's a bank behind the lobby with ATMs. 23. Easy to book Grab in the area. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel. It was extra nice since our room was upgraded. We will book here again when we go back to Singapore. Thank you so much!",

I chose this option because it included exclusive access to the Skyline Lounge on level 18, which I was eager to try. Upon entering the room, I was immediately greeted by automatically switched-on lights and curtains. The room was immaculately clean and well-stocked with amenities. There was a coffee machine, a mini bar with drinks, and TWG tea in the drawer. I was pleasantly surprised to find two separate toiletsone in the bedroom and one in the living room. The room also featured several paintings, adding to its charm. The view was breathtaking, with windows stretching across the entire room, offering stunning day and night views.A sidenote for One Farrer Hotel: the online photos dont do this room justice. It is truly stunning. Moreover, the service was outstanding. The receptionist quickly answered all our inquiries, even helping us with the coffee machine early in the morning. The staff, Malek at the Skyline Lounge were incredibly attentive, engaging with guests and ensuring our needs were met. We arranged vegetarian meals with him for both lunch and dinner, and the food was amazing. (Thank you, Malek!) Our entire stay was extremely pleasant and memorable. Thank you to the team for making it a special occasion that is unforgettable.",

Previously named Marina Mandarin, I chose this hotel because of its huge atrium and the bullet lifts. Unlike previous stays, I booked its Signature Marina Bay Room due to its panoramic view overlooking Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion. The room also had a balcony too. The check in process was smooth and easy. The staff handling my check in and check out was named Ivan who was always sincere and helpful. Thank you Ivan for making me feel home away home. The hotel had been completely renovated just liked a garden inside a hotel with lots of greenery. The room was decorated in contemporary style. One thing to note that the hotel stopped providing bottled water as an environmental friendly measure, rather filtered water supply was installed inside the washroom and it was claimed that guest could drink water from it directly.",

            "review_content": "Wow, what a wonderful week.Everything was beautiful at Park Royal Collection Marina Bay. A beautiful paradise. My friend had stayed before and recommended it for our girls weeklong getaway. We had 2 rooms on the 21st floor which you can imagine had incredible views. The rooms were lovely, spotless and spacious and oh the bed - heaven. The views from the Club Lounge on the 5th floor also were amazing. Hanging out on the 4th floor amongst the greenery and the birds was a treat where you could find a little nook and relax and keep cool.Collection Club Lounge Family go above and beyond and also Alice from housekeeping. In fact, everyone. Running into staff throughout the hotel, everyone was pleasant and helpful.Check in/check out was a breeze. Nothing was too much trouble for anyone. All the extra little touches during the week not only in the room but throughout the whole hotel.I had the pleasure of being spoilt by the Club lounge family I may not capture everyone here but you all know you did an amazing job of looking after the Aussie girls, and all of your guests. Me with the extra strong English Breakfast tea and salt for my scratchy throat before heading home !!Bala, Yarik, Syed, Lanee, Jenny and everyone. My apologies I have not listed everyones name but I dont wish to exclude anyone. You were all incredibly professional, welcoming, helpful, kind and worked so well together and made me laugh and relax. Not to forget to mention the beautiful food which changed daily for breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktail and canaps. Thank you Chef. Where to find my special orange juice now that I have left? Tasty drinks and delicious, beautifully presented food.Be sure to add Collection Club Lounge to your booking. Bala and the team will look after you. You will not regret it. It was hard to say goodbye. Until next time. Thank you so much from the Aussie girl.",

Special mention to, Fiona, who assisted us on the wedding day. While some hit & miss on the actual day, the Team was swift and changes were made promptly. Banquet manager, Darrel, was proactive and constantly updated us the status on ground. Which gave us a lot of assurance. Only feedback we have were the location of the AV helper for level 5 Atrium Ballroom was not the best as visual to floor was blocked, otherwise the food were great and definitely a high valued package and excellent service provided by the team.

We were served by Elyn and Darrell - both of whom helped to manage the flow and operations of the banquet impeccably. Elyn, Darrell and their crew really went the extra mile to make sure we were supported well: passing us water to make sure we were hydrated, helping me arrange my big dress, checking in with guests to make sure they were ok, helping us turn our chairs around to listen to the speeches. My bridesmaids dress ripped during the banquet and Elyn even helped to sew the seams back on. I have nothing but praise for all the staff serving that night ! Their attention to detail and wonderful service allowed my husband and I to fully enjoy ourselves that night without worrying about the small things ! Kudos also to Chef Lee for the wonderful food - everyone said it was delicious, AV manager Wan who helped with our audio/visual needs, and thanks again to our wedding manager Xina, who was lovely and supportive as usual. The team really epitomizes the spirit of service and dedication to their craft- putting us at the forefront and anticipating our needs before we knew we even had them. Because of them, I have highly recommended the hotel to all my friends who are looking to get married! :) its been a wonderful time with Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay we are so thankful to have chosen this venue.",

            "review_content": "I recently held my wedding banquet at PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay. If any soon-to-be newlyweds are still deciding which hotel to hold your banquet at, PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay should definitely be one of your top considerations. Everybody knows how beautiful the hotel is, but what is not as obvious is how excellent their service also is. The process of working together with my wedding coordinator, Xina, was amongst the top few collaborative experiences I had ever had in my life. For planning something as daunting as a wedding, you want a coordinator that catches any balls that you have dropped, allays your anxieties and keeps a tight timeline without adding additional stress. Xina was all that, and much much more. I can only imagine how many times Xina must have managed wedding banquets to be as experienced and skilful as she is. At each critical decision-making point, she explained the overall plan as well as the details clearly, highlighting the important choices we needed to make, but also offering insightful recommendations that helped us decide. Over the course of the year of wedding planning together with her, Xina never failed to give prompt reminders for deadlines for the payments we needed to make or documents we needed to complete together. But the mark of a great wedding coordinator, which Xina is, is the manner in which they make you feel throughout this stressful process. In the whole year we worked together, Xina was consistently polite, authentic and warm at no point did I feel frustration, stressed or awkward about approaching her to clarify any of my doubts. If I had any requests, Xina was always a text message or a phone call away and she was almost always available. While I wish for Xina to get more rest for herself, her speedy replies speak to her dedication and work ethic. Nearing the wedding, Xina carried herself with the same grace as she did throughout the whole year. Any hiccups were smoothly handled, and she did her very best to cater to unexpected requests that popped up along the way. We are so so happy and so so fortunate to have had Xina be our wedding coordinator. She is professional, dedicated, warm and gracious. Just as PARKROYAL COLLECTION claims to be inspiringly yours, Xina was inspiringly ours. I would not hesitate to recommend PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay as the venue for your wedding banquet or events. Once more, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Xina, for demonstrating the ethos and love her organisation preaches for their guests. Please please reward her for her impeccable and excellent work she is such a precious coordinator and has given her all for her couples.",

Despite road closures due to national day rehearsal, most guests were able to reach on time via public transport.During tea ceremony, Elyn and her team were willing to go the extra mile to ensure the ceremony proceeded smoothly such as helping our parents with their boutonniere and guided us on what to do. They also reminded our bridesmaids who were in charge of collecting the angbao to write the names of the family members at the back of the angbao so that we know who gave the angbao. Elyn and her team made us feel at ease during the wedding lunch and they were very attentive to our needs, even after the banquet such as giving extra water to the groom when he's intoxicated with alcohol. They also gave clear instructions on what to do throughout the banquet. Our guests complimented the food and I love the whole atmosphere. The foyer was brightly lit with natural sunlight. We held our wedding at the Atrium ballroom and it's a very cozy space for family and friends to mingle freely. AV guy Sham was also friendly and handled the AV well. Not sure if Howard was the one who opened the door, but I like that they left the door slightly open for us to watch our childhood montage before the march-in. That actually made me feel less nervous as I got to enjoy the video with my guests.I would have preferred if the hotel could provide more assurance regarding early check-in for the bridal suite and our request to leave the photo table props at their concierge two days before the wedding for convenience. We have asked for early check-ins multiple times but were told that early check-ins could not be guaranteed until the day itself and were discouraged from leaving the props at their concierge due to concerns about loss. I don't understand how they are willing to allow guests to leave their luggage with them but were hesitant about our items. Other hotels manage to arrange early check-in for newlywed couples in advance, which is crucial as we need the space to prepare and unload our belongings. While I understand the hotel's need to protect themselves regarding the photo table props, it has felt like they only prioritize the hotel's interests over accommodating the couple for such an important event in our lives.Overall, a pleasant wedding experience with the team and I am satisfied with the wedding lunch ops team. Not forgetting Bala whom we met at the Club Lounge for breakfast. Good service from him as he recommended food items for us to try.",

I feel this gesture has somewhat lost its way and its nice to see it being used. the dynamic duo of Zach and Aaron checked us in swiftly and managed to inform us oh the breakfast times, pool opening hours and location etc. Great to see their smiling faces and warm hospitality.As I was heading to the lifts and fumbling with the keycards and my wallet, a female staff patiently held the lift for us and assisted us with lift buttons. She found out that we were here to celebrate my wife's birthday and wished her a happy birthday! I later found out that the nice lady was actually the Rooms Div Manager Nadia.I would like to mention a special thank you to Cheah Yi who decorated the room and also arranged for the birthday cake for my wife.

We were initially worried as we were not familiar with some of the processes and sequence of the wedding, however with the constant step by step guidance by the team throughout the solemnization, tea ceremony, and each segment of the banquet, the entire event became a lot less stressful for us! We are really grateful to our wedding coordinator Jodi, our banquet managers Elyn and Jayson, the AV in charge Aniq, as well as the chefs behind the scenes for making our entire wedding ceremony a smooth and successful one. Special thanks to Jodi for your quick responses and for being so accommodating to our all requests, even up to the very last minute! And not forgetting Elyn for hand holding us through every step of the wedding and allowing us to enjoy the entire ceremony with an assured and calm state of mind!

We actually booked the hotel 18 months in advance because we were SO awed by the beauty, the natural light, and the birds in the hotel haha :) The food was delicious and we the chef was amendable to menu tweaks (like upgrading certain menu items to Iberico Pork, and adding on extra dessert). All in all, the staff really listen to you, and will do their best to make your vision come true.Shoutout to these staff members who made the wedding day extremely fuss-free and easy for us:Wedding Coordinator: Jodi & Fiona (both EXTREMELY responsive and helpful on WhatsApp over the past few months)Banquet Manager in Charge: Jayden (anticipated problems and helped provide solutions without us even asking) AV In Charge: Wan (very calm presence which helped us feel calm and grounded on the wedding day)Assistant: Vanessa (extremely helpful and constantly helped us with walking, with my gown etc, provided us with water, and non-alcoholic apple juice during our champagne toasting as we do not drink alcohol)11/10 service!

I sat at the bar counter as my friends and I always loved to chat with the bartenders to find out more about the thought process behind their drinks. On that day Jun Han the Head Mixologist at PLUME was working. We had a great chat with him and he explained why and how they had an inspiration of birds and cocktails and combined them together! I had a total of 3 drinks: THE ORIENTAL PIED HORNBILL, THE CRIMSON SUNBIRD and THE BLACK-NAPED ORIOLE! All super delicious! Most of their drinks tend to be more fruity, sour and floral kind of based instead of full-on spirit-forward which is nice because I enjoy these kinds of drinks~ But they do have classic cocktails which are spirit forwards as well such as a GodFather, Martinis and Old Fashioned (my other friend loves classic cocktails and she ordered these 3 and they were super delicious as well!) But nonetheless, Jun Han was a fantastic host and he helped recommend us those drinks as well! Really really good job PLUME! My friends and I had a great experience in PLUME! I will be back to try out THE BANDED WOODPECKER! Please drop a visit to PLUME I highly recommend it as a bar! And of course please look out for Jun Han and amazing guy to talk to! P.s.

We had an issue on the first night where none of our backlighting in the room turned off, but that was quickly resolved by their services team. Even though our room did not have a marina view, we did have a lovely view up on level 27 overlooking somewhat towards the ocean, it made for the best sun rises views. The lifts always took really really long to get to the level we are on, but that may have been due to lots of people using it. Overall a really good stay.",

            "review_content": "My partner and I booked a weekend stay as a birthday treat for me. We've been fortunate to have stayed a few times before and staying at the Grand Dame of Singapore is always a pleasure. We checked in early and checked out late the next day -- a nice touch by the reservations team. Thanks to Elina. And also to our butler Ancy -- the chocolate expert! We stayed in a studio suite in the main building, which has its own verandah overlooking the fountain courtyard. The suite, though small, is so quiet and relaxing, and a great way to unwind after a hectic week and to recharge for the next. Things we really enjoyed: -- Lunch at the pool bar, which is only open to in-house guests. Impeccable service by Arief and Hafiz at the pool bar, who looked after us on the two days we stayed. -- The Writers Bar -- an old favourite. Again excellent service -- attentive, friendly but not overwhelming. Apart from the polished performance of the staff, we just really like the cozy decor. It is a small bar but it's so comfortable and inviting. It's nice to just linger there and chat. -- Breakfast in the fountain courtyard. A nice way to start the day and the food selection (buffet or a la carte) is excellent. Service can be a bit slow at times -- not enough staff I suspect. It's also just nice to wander around the hotel, take in the history, look the famous people who've stayed over the years and to see how the hotel has changed with the times. Yes, Raffles can feel a bit commercial and capitalises heavily on its past. But service remains excellent and the hotel still retains an old-world charm, yet is up-to-date. And yes, it's pricey. But it's still a fab place to visit.",

No attention to detail had been spared - there was even a pillow for the bath. The staff were all so friendly and made us feel very welcome. Particular mention should be given to Roslee Sukar, the hotel's resident historian, who took us on a guided tour of the hotel. Roslee's enthusiasm for Raffles shone through and we would recommend anyone staying at Raffles to take the tour with Roslee. Our suite came with its own butlers, Reena and Thyra, who left me a lovely card, balloons and a little birthday cake for my birthday which was a lovely touch. The breakfast buffet was excellent. We enjoyed drinks in the Long Bar and the Writers Bar and had a lovely dinner at the Chinese restaturant, Yi by Jereme Leung. Everything about Raffles was luxurious. Obviously, all this comes at a cost, but we felt it was worth it for the experience we had.",

At the Writers Bar, Suren and Kali Johare were friendly and welcoming and made us exceptional drinks. They spent time with us to explain the different drinks and give us background and history on Raffles. We had such a fun time! Book a history tour with Roslee, the resident historian. He is so energetic and full of knowledge, and we learned so much from the tour while having a great time. Must-do!Thank you to Kasim for always greeting us so kindly and making us feel so welcome at Raffles! Our experience was seamless from start to finis. Our butler was very friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful and made us dinner/drinks reservations and organized late a check out and hotel transportation. Thank you!",

I took the bar, being on my own, I wanted to mix and chat to people.Service behind the bar was excellent, extremely friendly and quick serice. Had two slings and a cocktail. Threw my peanut shells on the floor as you do and enjoyed everything. Only reason 1 star removed was, ladly next to me asked me to pass her some coasters from where I was sitting. I did so and a waspy waitress told me off and said I had to ask for them. That would be fine if it had been for me, but I only passed them to the women next to me.

            "review_content": "We have stayed at a lot of very nice hotels over the years but nothing could have prepared us for our stay at this iconic hotel. We were a little apprehensive that it may have felt pretentious but how wrong we were. From the moment the doorman meets you at your car and welcomes you by name you know this is a special place. Check in is so different to any other check in. It takes place in your suite with your butler and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to the John Wayne suite which was such a privilege. Breakfast in the Tiffin room is an event as are drinks in the Long Bar and Writers Bar. Staff at the Long Bar were so helpful in reserving a table for us to allow us to skip the queues. One of the perks of being a resident. The weather was kind to us during our stay and we therefore spent a fair amount of time at the pool area. Clarence who looks after the pool bar is one of the nicest people you could wish to meet, a true gentleman. When walking around the hotel all the staff know your name, we really dont know how they do this but it just adds to the feeling of being part of the Raffles family. Wonderful. Yes its expensive but this is Raffles, probably the best hotel we will ever be fortunate enough to stay in. The building is fantastic and attention to detail unparalleled but, without doubt, its the staff (each and everyone of them) that makes Raffles what it is. A massive thank you to all of them. Finally one last thing to mention is the history tour which is complimentary. You learn so much about the hotel and is well worth doing. Thank you Nazir, your tour was so enjoyable. If youre thinking of staying just do it, you wont be disappointed.",

Before checking it at the Raffles, we had 12 nigths at Langkawi Islands. beautiful place, nice hotel, excellent food. For these 12 nights we payed less than for our \"1-night-stand\" at the Raffles. But it was worth every single cent. In the middle of a more than modern town you can enjoy a breath of the past. But it is not like a museum, because it is a relativly open space and not a strictly gated community. Staff is friendly, far away from stiff and more than helpful. And everybody we met was obviously proud of working at this place. We are very glad for this experience, even if we are not sure if we can manage to repead it. But anyway, when we will be in Singapore next March, we will definetly try to have a Singapore Sling in the garden of the Raffles....",

The Writers Bar was my favourite, where I could perch at the bar and speak to the wonderful bar staff and other guests.Raffles isnt just a hotel; its the destination. Ive stayed at many 5-star hotels, but none like this. Despite the high (but fair - its worth every cent) price point, there is no pretentiousness to be found at Raffles. The staff all have a genuine love for their jobs. Their friendliness is real and they magically seem to know all guests names :-) Their attention to detail and personalised dedication to going above and beyond is what makes this hotel truly special.I am already planning my next trip - thank you for the most spectacular memories that I will never forget :-)",

We are fortunate to be in a position to travel extensively and have stayed at many wonderful properties around the world, but one thing is, The Raffles is by far our preferred property. From the front office staff who sort out our bookings, The Butlers who look after us during our stay, Housekeeping who do such a wonderful job which might I add cannot be faulted, keeping in mind my wife is very picky in the cleaning department, to the concierge department, they were all very professional and attentive.We had two Palm Court Suite's next to each other, which i would recommend if you have family with you, they are large and as you would expect are luxuriously appointed. The raffles have several room types and we have tried them all over the years and they are all very luxurious appointed, so it just boils down to preference. Location is perfect and is across the road from Raffles City shopping center which has many shops and dining options. That said, the inhouse restaurants and in room dinning cannot be faulted, as you would expect from Raffles. We highly recommend if you are looking at wanting a fantastic experience, I would always recommend The Raffles, don't even hesitate. Thank you to everyone at Raffles who made my 60th birthday such a memorable experience for not only myself but my whole family you made not only me but the whole family feel very special.",

The airport isnt far away and on arrival, the welcome is instant and perfect. We were shown to our room - an upgrade to the Noel Coward suite. In fact this room is rather smaller than the room I had booked but it is in a small wing of the old part of the building which was nice. The rooms are of course beautifully appointed. A/C worked a bit too well for us though - and the bed isnt the most comfy - but everything else is superb. The crowning glory of course are all the staff who are clearly trained to an incredible standard. Breakfast was delightful - I had the local breakfast of curry something on two mornings which was well worth trying. We had a morning by the roof-top pool and enjoyed that. A highlight for me was a tour around parts of the hotel by a Gentleman whose name I sadly dont recall - but hes been at the hotel forever and has plenty of good stories. The Long Bar is a must and we were told to walk past the long queue and announce ourselves as hotel guests - thank goodness as the wait time was boringly long. Mrs W loved the Singapore Sling - I thought it was horrid. But it was concocted for women! I loved the Writers Bar. Small and classy with killer cocktails. All in all, great fun. Reassuringly giant bill and Im sure well be back one day.",

Never once felt like an inconvenience to staff, who were always eager to help with a smile and gratitude to serve. Vikram at the front door was especially amazing, recommending places to go each day. The rooms are spacious, impeccably kept, and full of amenities They even brought my wife a legitimate transformer so she could use her American hair dryer. Daily breakfast was also perhaps the very best hotel breakfast I have ever had.This is a legitimate five star property. Yes, it is significantly pricier than the other five star properties in Singapore, but worth every penny. It is a premium property well beyond the others.",

Dinner in the Tiffin Room was special and none of the selections disappointed. Our only regret was the shortness of our stay. There are other luxury hotels in Singapore but nothing as special as Raffles. From the impressive doormen, the butler and other service providers all provided a faultless service which made the stay memorable.

Wency even gave us small gift and handwritten card. So simple but very sweet gesture. Thats why we made sure to meet him before we checked out.

Could tell as soon as we were dropped off at the entrance that the Shangri La was one of the better hotels, in fact a top notch hotel. Our heavy cases (we'd just had over 6 weeks travelling round Australia) were efficiently whisked away. The first sight of the foyer was pretty impressive. The reception staff were professional and pleasant. Our spacious room was in the garden wing which suited us. Plenty of comfortable chairs and balcony furniture although it was so hot and sticky we didn't sit outside for too long. The bathroom was well set out with a convenient washing line over the bath. Loads of storage for clothes. Spotlessly clean. Just took a long time for the shower to warm up but as its a hot climate maybe a hot shower wasn't a good idea. The range of breakfast food was incredible, catering to both Western and oriental tastes. And to have our eggs freshly cooked was a luxury as most places we stayed on our travels served less than hot food.The gardens were beautiful and well tended. There was always someone tidying up or cleaning inside and out. We didnt use the pool but it was big and well set out with lifeguards on duty.As we only had the internet to find out about places to visit we would've welcomed some leaflets and maps and also information about the hotel services. Very handy for someone who doesn't know their way round.Saying that though, the Shangri La is a stylish, well run hotel.",

Full pan Asian breakfast every day, great for the kids with so many options and quantity! Accessible ways to get everywhere, the gym, pool, restaurant. Lovely lobby and bar, very classy.",

Because he was off on the day we are leaving, he took time to say goodbye and wishes us well. We enjoyed the cookies and tea treats. Thank you, Wency for being thoughtful. I will miss your smiling face and friendliness! Special thanks to Carlo (he wears the Tibetan costume) good with providing walking directions to surrounding areas. In addition, thank you for telling us about the shuttle service to ION Mall. Thanks for being attentive and friendly.",

            "review_content": "Our good experience started when we arrived early at 8.30 am after a late night sleepless well before check in time. Although we were unable to get an earlier than the standard check in time, Irfan, the receptionist who dealt with us, did offer a complimentary breakfast. Due to his good interpersonal skills and his advice we decided to pay extra for a Horizon Club room for the three nights stay which did allow us immediate access to our room as well as the other club amenities. Every aspect of our room worked perfectly. The rooms are well designed, made of quality materials, fully resourced and comfortable. The Horizon club lounge provided a substantial evening cocktail buffet which meant that we did not need to leave the hotel for dinner. The staff there are very professional and well trained. Special mention to Viola, Milan, Gary and Paul for their friendly and efficient service. The location is quite close to Orchard street shopping centres within a reasonable walking distance, and the hotel provides an hourly shuttle service between 11.00 am and 4.00 pm. Regarding the hotel location, it is more situated in the business area rather than the more typical tourist locations. As we have been travelling for about 7 years, this was not a problem for us. Anyway, there is good and cheap public transport to any and all tourist areas. The only detraction is that we feel that the air conditioning in the public areas such as the downstairs lobby was a bit too cool if you wanted to sit there for an extended period. We would highly recommend a stay in this beautiful hotel.",

Very kid friendly with a wonderful kids club/playroom and water park, and thoughtful welcome bag. This included a fun scavenger hunt activity sheet, which required the kid to explore the hotel grounds and speak to staff to fill in the answers. Great way to get familiar with the hotel. Breakfast buffet - one of the better breakfast buffets. So much choice! Staff were a little slow with clearing tables though. Same at lunch time, it gets busy and they seem a bit understaffed in the main restaurant. Lobby lounge - had lunch there. Beautiful and comfortable decor, massively high ceilings. Food was beautifully presented. The bak kut teh was delicious. Great service. Gym - one the better hotel gyms Ive been to! Its huge! 7 treadmills, 7 elliptical, 3 bikes and all the usual weights and cable machines. There were also kettlebells, fit balls, and resistance bands. And even has a zero runner machine. Never seen one of those before. And a designated stretch area. Really appreciate how spacious and clean it was. Pools - great for kids and families. The pool towels have a little hood to go over the lounger. So clever. The water park for the kids was amazing for younger kids. Kids club buds was amazing. There is a huge ball pool and obstacle course/climbing frames, music room with piano, drums, cymbals and karaoke machine, and a big art room for painting (inc painting on the walls). Theres also a kids kitchen for cooking classes for ages 5+Minor annoyances: Tried to do the mobile check in but frustratingly wasnt able to scan the passport page. The wardrobe sliding door came off the hinge but it was repaired within the day. Check in was a bit slow, but courteous Upon arrival, the safe battery was faulty (unable to lock) but the staff dealt it with it promptly. Within the same day, it started to constantly beep. The technician arrived quickly and was able to fix it within 30 mins. However by day 4, we had to call for repair 3 more times. In the end we asked that it be replaced as it was clearly faulty, but it never was. Very frustrating that there was no follow up. Room: spacious and clean. Hotel grounds. There is a fruit, herb and vegetable garden. It was a great activity to explore it with my kid, especially for educational purposes. Theres a lovely koi pond and waterfall garden, and The Orchid was very pretty.",

I have stayed at many of the other 5-star hotels in Singapore, and have found the majority of them to be either hilariously small for a supposed luxury experience, generally inconsistent with their room quality, or experiencing teething issues from a constant turnover of employees. While I primarily collect loyalty points at the other major hotel loyalty programs, I stay at Shangri-La Singapore often enough to qualify for a Shangri-La Jade membership entirely from my stays at this hotel alone.My favorite thing about this hotel is how dependable and consistent it is: their spacious rooms are always sparkling clean so I never have to worry about any nasty surprises when it comes to bed-linens, and its seasoned staff always know exactly what to do and how to handle any situation. This is a 5-star hotel that actually knows how to provide a 5-star experience.A special shout-out to Jega from the concierge team, who always receives me with a warm welcome home whenever I arrive late at night from my flight! I had a bit of an issue with my booking during my last visit, but it was handled graciously by the reception staff as well and for that I am very appreciative. Already looking forward to my next stay!(Added bonus of the hotel: the gym is 24 hours! I love being able to fit in a workout at the end of my day without any rush.)",

Splash and Buds were probably the highlights of the stay for my toddler. The staff were friendly across the different facilities, starting from the main entrance to the reception and every amenity / restaurant. The Line got busy between 8:30 to 10, but had a good buffet spread while the evening tea in the Horizon club lounge was very enjoyable.

The architecture and sculptures around the lobby already made our eyes feast. Our stress instantly gone the moment our eyes saw, our noses smelled and our skin felt the air in that lobby. That itself was already a grandeur experience. So my husband and I said to each other, okay that was a 5-star experience. We were greeted by a staff, too bad I forgot her name who instantly took my kids attention so I can complete all the check-in formalities. My kids got the goodies bags, packed with all things nice for my little ones: colouring book, colouring pens and pencils, toothbrush, toothpaste, kids shampoo, kids baby wash, cookies, kids slippers, and the bag itself can be coloured! The staff also made sure my kids got entertained while I was settle the check-in stuffs. In the level where our room was, had a family corner where guests can loan strollers, toys, get diapers, do bottles washing, microwave food, baby chair, feeding table literally EVERYTHING YOU NEED for kids below 12! We loaned some toys and chessboard, which the kids totally enjoyed.We also got complimentary cake for my sons birthday. This was a very kind, sweet and thoughtful gesture. We very much appreciate it. And the mothers day room package that we took came with self-care box and a bouquet of flowers! The bouquet was super pretty and smelled so good so I highly recommended getting the mothers day package to my friends.We were surprised to see our room immediately get cleaned in that same evening we went for swimming. Usually for one-night stay, hotel staff will not do housekeeping. So we were amazed! My kids loved the Splash and Buds! Splash is free for all guests while Buds came free because we took the family room. The buffet breakfast at the Line was also great. I can highly recommend the waffles! Our Guest Relations Officer, Wency, was super nice! He made sure we were nicely settled in, he personally delivered the bouquet which was super sweet. He also made sure all our questions were answered as it was our first time staying at Shangri-la. He was so thoughtful and very friendly. So I took his business card and will make sure to contact him on our next stay.Overall, it was an amazingly unforgettable experience! The kids wanted to come back as it was the best hotel for them. Even for me and my husband. The hospitality, warmth, the room, amenities, foods, everything were all outstanding! We will surely come back and this will be our top hotel to recommend to all our relatives and friends.",

            "review_content": "Best family hotel in Singapore. We stayed at Shangrila Orchard 4 years ago with our son, and now coming back again but this time also with our daughter for her first time. The hotel is just as good, if not better than the first visit. We stayed in the family floor with access to laundry and dryers, ensuring the kids had clean clothes (to get dirty again) when we go out. The rooms were impeccably clean and well thought out. Amenities for the kids and a canopy bed which my older son loved. Food was delicious and options plenty. My Daughter has a number of food allergies and finding food for her was the biggest worry for us on our trip. For breakfast, we were thankful the chef came out to speak to us about what she could and couldn't eat. Chef Jaya also personally cooked my daughters meal to avoid any cross contamination. We also visited the Italian restaurant (Waterfall) and the chef also cooked a beautiful pizza and pasta for her free of her allergens. We did have a medical emergency due to our stay and the hotel was so accommodating, and looked after us while we were going through a very stressful time. I would like to thank Nick L (F&B) and Ash (front desk), as well as the rest of the hotel staff for looking after us and really turning around a stressful couple of days due to the medical emergency into something magical for my daughter. She felt like a princess and that means the world to us. Highly recommend Shangrila Orchard for anyone with families or special requirements. The hotel will treat you like family. My kids didn't want to leave, and neither did we!",

Thanks for giving my child the kid's bag and showing us to the Garden wing!We had booked a family terrace which was large enough to fit 4 pax. Things we liked about the room - sofa bed was comfortable and had a fan above. The bathtub was great too. The whole room was kid friendly with amenities and a nice teepee tent. The garden terrace was lovely, but there was too many mosquitoes to have a proper tea outside. We wished there was a bidet in the toilet and free water and some minibar drinks. The weather was hot n we were too tired to sort out the water dispenser.The kids facilities - Buds and the pool were the main highlight. My child had a great time in the painting room. Too bad we did not get to try Splashes. For food and coffee, we really enjoyed the Shophouse. Highly recommend getting some bites from there.Would we come again? Its a 50/50 for us. The hotel is beautiful for sure and kids friendly but at that price point, we did not feel that wow factor that will pull us back. It was a nice anniversary celebration though and kudos to the staff who assisted with the cake!",

The hotel is very convenient located, there is a shuttle service all day to Orchard Road, save the guests the hassle of taking a taxi. Due to the large amount of guests passing through, some area of the hotel is a bit dated. The rooms in the Horizon building were renovated a couple of years ago but already showing age. We stayed in the Horizon club rooms. The staff were always kind and lovely. We had an issue with the renovation started on the floor a day early. Zoe, the manager of Horizon club sorted it out for us. Thank you so much. She provided excellent care and service. There was a large group staying at the hotel for a weekend conference, all the lifts to the rooms had long queue. One of the guest services saw us and was so kind to escort us to the back lifts so we wouldn't have to wait. The pool area is what we loved the most. The hotel pool feels like you are in a tropical resort instead of a city centre hotel. It's very spacious, with lots of greenery, great staff. It's one of my girls' favourite hotel pools. We wished it would open a tad later to 8pm instead of 7pm. We went to the pool everyday at golden hour. It was just so pretty and peaceful. Thank you Shangri-La, see you next time.",

What is really clever is how this manages to be both a perfect hotel for business and solo travellers and also for families by keeping the kids activities away from the lobby/main area.

Breakfast was ok, club mellisme lounge is a small space but in general was never crowded during our visit so it wasnt an issue, the canaps and drinks offered in the lounge were good and the high tea as well had some very nice plating of snacks to eat. The downside was the hotel dosent have a spa and In room dining is not 24 hours. The dining options as well are limited including the IRD menu. But whatever food we had at the hotel we were happy with it. As Accor silver plus member we got complimentary welcome drinks but the selection of drinks to choose from were limited as well when compared to fairmont/ swissotel which offer the entire cocktail menu in the welcome drink selection. The best part of our stay were the really welcoming staff who always greeted us with a nice warm smile. Really felt welcomed with their hospitality.",

Both of us would like to thank the banquet team during our wedding and we have received positive feedback from our guests about the staff and food. We would like to extend our deepest and most sincere appreciation for the following two;Agnes Teo (Senior Sales Manager) Yi Ping (Banquet staff)Agnes is hardworking, efficient, passionate and accommodating. She listens attentively to our wants and promptly replies to our queries even after her working hours. Her sincerity and positivity made us feel at ease with our wedding planning. She went out of her way to facilitate our requests and personally ensured everything ran smoothly on the day of the dinner. Thank you Agnes, we truly appreciate you! Yi Ping provided us with outstanding and genuine service during our banquet. Her initiative and attentiveness towards my wife and I was heartwarming. She was well prepared and took very good care of our welfare by offering us water and even helping to calm our nerves prior to our march in ceremonies. Overall, my wife and I are so happy with choosing Sofitel City Centre to host our wedding dinner. The service was top notch, facilities were amazing and we felt that we had nothing to worry about with a solid and dependable team to work with. Thank you for making our special day ever so memorable!",

So if you park on weekends, you can do 48 hours like me with no issues).Cons -1) Pool is rather narrow (probably only 2 people can swim abreast).All in all, a great stay.",

He provided invaluable recommendations of local attractions, assisted us with all our needs, and always did so with a warm and friendly demeanor.We were pleasantly surprised by the high standard of staff training at Sofitel. Harvey exemplifies the level of excellence that makes this hotel stand out.

Wow very nice touch. I would like to express my gratitude for the overall excellent service and high-quality facilities during my recent stay at your hotel. All staff member Lucy, Jason, Lisa and few more forget the name asl .. halib .. kler sorry if I spelled wrongly. The concierge provided recommendations for our dinner that night and they were perfect for our budget and atmosphere we had in mind. thanks to Ali & shamsah. Housekeeping was incredibly thoughtful, including leaving personalised notes of their name. Thank you for your services.They truly went above and beyond to make out experience memorable. I will definitely be coming back to the Fullerton Bay hotel again. Luxurious ambience, attentive staff - everything you could want with lovely views over the Bay view and within easy walking distance from the raffle to Marina Bay. Excellent food and very helpful, friendly staff team. The la braserie cake counter was superb and we loved the swimming pool and gym looking over the bay view. Thank you!",

When I arrived around 7pm there was no one at the check in desk, and two other guests waiting there told me theyd been waiting for a while. I ended up waiting probably 12-15 minutes total not ridiculous but not what Id expect from a hotel like this. When I went to check out a few days later, around 6:45am, there was again no one present. While I waited, I tried the mobile checkout link but it did not work. I hopped in my Uber and tried calling them on my way to the airport, but no one answered. Finally got through on the phone when I was through airport security, and the woman who answered told me to check out at the front desk. When I told her that I had tried to do just that and had also been frustrated at the non functional app and the lack of anyone to answer my call, she was a little rude and defensive. I filled all of this out in a customer service questionnaire they sent, but no one ever cared to follow up. In summary, still a great hotel, but the staff and management may not live up to what youd expect in Singapore.",

The staff were the most helpful and pleasant I have experienced in any hotel, with no queues to check in or out, or at any other time. We arrived early, but our room was made available and our luggage (many cases and bags) was waiting for us when we got to the room. The Club level dining area was really convenient, being close to our room and offering a quieter area to eat than the restaurant. It would still have been good if there had been a choice to have breakfast either in the Club level area or the restaurant without incurring an additional charge, but this is the only suggestion for improvement that I have. This would certainly be my choice of hotel on any future visit to Singapore.",

Despite the nearby construction site, the hotel's excellence shone through.I've had the pleasure of experiencing their outstanding service twice - once during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and again recently. Both times, they exceeded my expectations. During a challenging time, they provided a safe and comfortable haven, and this time around, they continued to impress with their high standards.Special shoutouts to Sandeep, our room cleaner, and Katie Soh Zhi Ying, the guest service agent, who went above and beyond to ensure our stay was seamless and enjoyable. Their professionalism, enthusiasm, and personalized service made a lasting impression on me.From the immaculate rooms to the outstanding staff, the hotel's commitment to excellence is evident in every detail. I'm grateful for the wonderful experiences and look forward to many more stays in the future! This hotel truly is a gem, and I can't wait to return!",

I opted for the exclusive club lounge with absolutely no regrets. Whilst the views of the Singapore Cityscape are unparalleled, it truly is the service that takes the cake. Their genuine care and concern for us allowed them to anticipate our needs toward making treasured memories for us. I arrived in true annoying Singaporean-style, early so the room was obviously not ready but were nonetheless warmly welcomed to the club lounge by Firdaus and Diyan which ended up being a real treat with thoughtfully curated canaps. Being a club room, we were assigned a room on the upper floors where we had a spectacular view of the Kallang- we really got the best of both worlds with the view of the marina at the lounge and the Kallang in our room. Id like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Naren on the laundry team as well as TK from Engineering. I had a dress that needed to be pressed by dinner and Naren took it upon himself to make sure that that was done in a mere hour. Similarly, TK magically installed a bidet within 15 minutes of my request (and I say magical because other hotels have sadly failed in this regard). Denish, Devan and Kanna at Guest Services made it possible to surprise my fiance when Id forgotten to bring a blindfold to pick him up from the airport and speedily suggested and handed me a black face mask. I think what was really amazing was that they remembered and when we arrived back at the hotel, they wordlessly took our bags and escorted us all the way back to the room. This continued at the club lounge where Javier, Satish, Sam, Aiman presented us with a cake Id left them earlier and gave us a great, quiet table to celebrate. They even took a Polaroid against the magnificent view (so cute!) to give to us as a gift on check-out. Javier and Satish took the initiative to let us know the buffet would be closing and gave us a quick tour of the food and their personal recommendations so we could get something to eat. I say buffet because this is unlike any evening cocktail presentation Ive experience with a live hot food station. Needless to say, we cancelled our dinner reservation. We received the same excellent service at breakfast and had the pleasure of meeting Firdaus again and Alwyn who remembered and somehow communicated our preferences across the team from the day before and went above and beyond to prepare a beautiful eggs Benedict which was not available at the lounge for my fianc. We spend the rest of the day at the lounge, enjoying and observing the way the team worked in concert and interacted with us as well as other guests. They engaged us with excellent conversation without being intrusive. I had",

There is a new higher end version of a hawker center nearby. Great pool but poolside service was slow, 15-20 minutes to get a cocktail. Excellent spa. They let us use the shower there while waiting for check-in. The Colony buffet was an eating highlight and worth a visit.

The hotel has a wonderful breakfast with every option you could want. The gym has very good quality machines. The pool is large and was well utilised by my family. The hotel hosts an impressive amount of fine art and a wander through the hotel to see them all is a must. The service was of the highest calibre. We were kindly upgraded which was greatly appreciated. Whilst waiting to check in (a very short wait) we were offered drinks and refreshments. They even accommodated our late check out caused by our airline. We have stayed in many luxury hotels all over the world and I must say that this is probably in the top 3 for service. We cant wait to come back again! If you are visiting Singapore soon, dont hesitate, book this hotel. You wont regret it.

We booked the Deluxe Suite, which was quite spacious and very well-appointed, with great views of Marina Bay. Theres a Nespresso machine for the coffee lovers. The bathroom is very large, with a double sink, walk-in shower, bathtub and excellent bath robes. The staff is super friendly and helpful, be it for tips around the city, restaurant reservations or even little local spots to visit. The housekeeping staff were really wonderful, with an eye for detail. They had left a couple of surprises in the room, which were a delight and appreciated. The Republic Bar in the lobby is a must-visit. The ambiance is magnificent, with amazing cocktails and super friendly staff. Its a great spot to enjoy a pre-dinner drink or simply spend the entire evening there. All that said, the highlight of our stay here was having met Anjo - the mixologist/bartender at Republic. This young gentleman went above and beyond at every possible occasion!! He is attentive, gracious, polite and hospitable. He is the definition of exceptional service, quick to engage in conversation and knowing when to give us space to relax. Always smiling and always happy to see us pop in for a coffee or a drink, he truly made the difference between an ordinary stay and an extraordinary one. He even went out of his way for the birthday celebration, offering up drinks and even a cake! When we had friends over for drinks, he arranged a special cocktail for all of us. I would recommend dropping by just to meet this wonderful human being, even if youre not staying at the hotel (of course, I do recommend staying here too, as it is a really great spot)!

She is nice and cheerful as well. Room is clean and decent. Amenities are good and very enough to us. One thing is the TV does not work very well but it does not really matter as I did not spend time on watching TV. Housekeeping staff Prink and He Qing gave me a surprise that they gave me a make up mirror on the working table as they found I did make up on the table. I was shocked and feeling so happy about this. Thank you very much!I also went to the bar of Republic and their Cocktails are absolutely good! You must try a drink of cocktail over there! Republic is top 50s bar in Asia!",

They arranged for Jet Quay to escort us through the immigration process and arranged for their transportation to pick us up at the airport. Upon arrival, we were greeted by several staff and escorted straight to our Marina Bay room on the 21st floor, where check-in was conducted privately and stress-free. Waiting was a birthday cake for my mom to celebrate her birthday. Throughout our stay, we met so many friendly and helpful staff, giving us all kinds of recommendations for what to do and eat in the city. Housekeeping and in-room dining did an amazing job of addressing any requests, and keeping the room in exceptional condition. The food was excellent, and the hotel was located in such a convenient location making it easy to get to attractions, food, and for walking. Every day we out and came back, we were greeted by the staff, making us feel very welcome. I look forward to our next stay and would recommend this hotel.",

They patiently explained to us their products and brough us to amenities section.Sauna, steam room and jacuzzi were available.Afterwards, went to massage room to start the session. Room ambience was awesome. Room lighting, music, smell etc, were all on point. You will already expect the massage session to be good when the bed was soft but provided good support. Sheets were silky smooth. Most importantly, the face rest was at the perfect angle.My masseur was Orca. Very Friendly and professional. No unnecessary conversation. Techniques and strength were on point.Had the best 90 mins massage/sleep in my life.Conclusion:The Ritz Carlton Spa will set your massage expectation to a whole new level. It will pamper you, spoil you, and leave you wanting for more.Sen.",

The 5 food presentations daily are always exceptional, the views amazing, the access to the Club cars so convenient.Though what makes the Club access here stand head and shoulders above anywhere else we've ever stayed are the wonderful Ladies & Gentlemen that make up the staff there.We must thank the amazing Chuck De Guzman for organizing our stay, he epitomises the word 'Gentleman' in every aspect.We also must thank Jasper & Moira who everyday made our time special with lots of laughs, local suggestions and their gracious service. It was fun celebrating Lunar New Year with them. No review can be written without mentioning Chefs Sundar, Benson & Bernice who all guaranteed that we never went hungry with their delicious food and that we left far heavier than when we arrived!A special thank you to the wonderful Lam from the laundry department who has looked after us for 9 years, greeting every phone call with her cheery disposition and always remembering us year after year.

I didnt intend to stay somewhere fancy, but my husband insisted we try The Ritz to witness the hype. What did we find? - A staff greeted us at the front door (at 10:30pm) to guide us to the lobby and give us a briefing of the hotel. - An instant room upgrade to the 29th floor, just because. - Exceptionally friendly service by the front desk attendant Nadia (who later wrote us a handwritten note that made me cry). - Excellent food and beverages at Colony Restaurant and Republic Bar.- Another room upgrade to a corner suite because of some repair works to another room on our floor. Also some chocolates and desserts sent to our room for the inconvenience.What made it memorable for us was not just the million dollar views, amenities, lavish hotel interiors and the hotel generosity in their giveaways, but the exceptional service we received. Each and every staff member made us feel like royalty, as if we were the Prince and Princess of Wales. Always asking if they can do better, as if customer service is core to their values. Ive experienced quite a few amazing hotels in my lifetime, but none quite as memorable as The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore. We left our 6 day stay making friends with the staff that have shown us what customer service is really about. My 20 photos and their captions highlight The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore in every way. Quality and care. We cannot wait to come back.Special shout out to the incredible staff at Colony Restaurant, Kristine the hostess, Frecel at front of house, Firdausi and Tessa the Assistant Managers, Carmela the supervisor, chef Ganesh (for all the laughs at breakfast) and one very kind human, John. We miss you all. Also shout out to Camila at Republic Bar and Nikko at the pool for contributing to our amazing experience.",

For dinner, staff at the restaurant were always friendly and quick with my order.The room was the perfect size for me, for my two week stay, as it has space for all your clothes, a place to store suitcases, and a mini fridge were a stored soft drinks and milk.I used the gym a couple of times and the facilities are good, having all the basic equipment.The pool is fantastic to just relax and order a drink to enjoy by the poolside.I would recommend this place to anybody going to Singapore.",

At first, we didn't expect much from the room, I mean, it's Singapore and hotel stays are expensive and mostly with smaller spaces. But at Yotel Singapore Orchard, they really know how to utilize compact spaces without making it feel cramped. You can enjoy city view from the bathroom (toiletshower, the sink is outside the bathroom), instead of the room. Of course, there are double curtains for your privacy, but it's still a unique layout. The room was provided with a desk with wireless charger, kettle with coffee & tea, ironironboard, and TV with various channels and Chromecast option. The bed can be inclined and reclined so you can watch the TV comfortably. Those who stay for business would appreciate the facilities provided in the room. Unfortunately, since we only stayed for a night, we didn't get to experience the pool, gym, even the robot service. But, we will definitely put this hotel on top of our list to stay the next time we're in Singapore.",

            "review_content": "I am so grateful to the staff at this wonderful hotel - my wife was stranded in singapore and sick, and the staff went out of their way to help her and my kid, e.g. walking her around the local pharmacies to find the right medicine in the middle of the night and generally making sure they were ok. And it was clear that the night staff let the day staff know about her needs when the shifts changed - amazing dedication. This exceeds the service you'd expect at all hotels, including luxury brands. The rooms are surprisingly spacious due to clever design, e.g. bed which turns into full-size sofa, and bunk beds. Normally 14 square meters is a pigenhole, but in this hotel clever use of space means its comfortable for 2.Thanks again and we'll be back.",

Yolanda especially was amazing, Yoshi could have his own funny line.Breakfast was good and had lot of things available also for special diets. Some variety with foods would have been fun, but everything was good never the less. The pool area was nice.Location is truly perfect for a stay in Singapore. We were able to travel anywhere from near by bus stops or metro stations and a lot of things were only a short walk away.",

Additionally, their two robots Yoshi & Yolanda are sure to win your hearts. While room sizes may be compact, the well-designed layout ensures a comfortable stay. There is complimentary water & amenities and the breakfast buffet was really amazing and a great add-on.

There is plenty of shopping and eating nearby, and it's a great base or exploring Singapore. The other big thing is the rooms. My room was very compact, but also very functional - panels in the walls hide a fold-down desk and an ironing board, and there's a tiny fridge and a safe. The bed is super-comfy. The bathroom arrangement is unconventional, but a big winner - one wall is the window facing on to the street, which provides a great view and plenty of light into the room. The hotel has a fun vibe to it, with its purple-coloured theme and robots to deliver items to rooms. Would definitely stay there again.",
